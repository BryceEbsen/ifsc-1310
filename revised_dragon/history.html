    <p>SpaceX began developing the Dragon spacecraft in late 2004, making a public announcement in 2006 with a plan of entering service in 2009.
    Also in 2006, SpaceX won a contract to use the Dragon spacecraft for commercially supplied resupply services to the International Space Station for the American federal space agency, NASA.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During its maiden flight in December 2010, Dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully from orbit.
    On 25 May 2012, a cargo variant of Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to the International Space Station (ISS).
    SpaceX is contracted to deliver cargo to the ISS under NASA's Commercial Resupply Servicesprogram, and Dragon began regular cargo flights in October 2012.  
    With the Dragon spacecraft and the Orbital ATK Cygnus, NASA seeks to increase its partnerships with domestic commercial aviation and aeronautics industry. 
    On 3 June 2017, the CRS-11 capsule largely assembled from previously flown components from the CRS-4 mission in September 2014 was launched again for the first time, with the hull, structural elements, thrusters, harnesses, propellant tanks,
    plumbing and many of the avionics reused while the heat shield, batteries and components exposed to sea water upon splashdown for recovery were replaced.</p>

    <h3>Configurations</h3>
    
    <h4>Cargo</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><h5>DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES:</h5>
    <p>Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and currently
    the only cargo spacecraft flying capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth.
    Dragon accommodates pressurized cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.</p></li>

    <li><h5>VERSATILE CARGO RACKS:</h5>
    <p>The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment.
    They accommodate a variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological samples.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Crew</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><h5>PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA:</h5>
      <p>Dragon was designed from the outset to fly humans to space. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is making upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew carrying capability.</p></li>

      <li><h5>CREW UPGRADES:</h5>
      <p>Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reliable crew transport vehicle, with seating for seven,
      life-support systems, controls with manual capability, and a powered launch escape system.</p></li>

      <li><h5>FIRST LAUNCH:</h5>
      <p>Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. Dragon’s first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Dragon Lab</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><h5>FACILITATING RESEARCH:</h5>
      <p>DragonLab is a free-flying, unmanned platform designed for research and testing in a microgravity environment independent of the International Space Station.</p></li>

      <li><h5>LONGEVITY:</h5>
      <p>It can transport payloads, experiments, instruments, and sensors into space and back to Earth on missions ranging from one week to two years.</p></li>
      
      <li><h5>CAPABILITIES:</h5>
      <p>DragonLab can readily accommodate instrument and sensor testing, space physics and relativity experiments, radiation effects research, and many other microgravity tests.</p></li>
