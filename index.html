  <h2>Thought on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy that focuses on getting the content on the website then adds more complicated design elements based on the user's browser.
  This is important for modern web design because of how many different browsers and platforms are available to users. By using progressive enhancement a developer is able to ensure 
  everybody gets the content of the website and those with the latest browser get the best experience.</p>

  <h2>Final Project Reflection</h2>
  <p>The final project was a great learning experience. It really helped me to figure out how HTML and CSS play together. 
  For the most part I did not have any issues with the HTML. I found that part of the final project fairly easy. However, when I got to the CSS I
  ran into several issues. It took me a long time to get my hedder styled. The background images were not wanting to work properly. It took me a long time
  to get the size correct and keep the image from repeating.</p>
  
  <p>If I had to start over now I think I would not use images for backgrounds. They were a lot of work and caused more problems than I think that they were worth.
  I think the experience I gained from using them was good, but I do not think I would choose to do that again.</p>
  
  <p>From the feedback I received I changed my faq page to use a solid black background. I did this because I agreed that the repeating space background makes the 
  page look messy. I also added a javascript picture cycle. I added this just for fun. Finally, I got some feedback talking about how the picture I used as a background 
  on the history and hard page made the text a little hard to read. I agree with this feedback, but I did not change it because removing the image would ruin what I was 
  trying to do for the aesthetic page.</p>
